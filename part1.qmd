## Can Machine Think ?

@Turing1950

- Defining a machine
- Understanding "thinking"

## The Imitation Game

::: columns
::: column
Context:

- A: Man
- B: Woman
- C: Interrogator

Rules:

- A and B are known as X and Y to C
- C interrogates X and Y
- Responses are typewritten
:::

::: column
Objectives:

- C's Goal: 
  - Determine 'X is A and Y is B' or 'X is B and Y is A'
- A's Goal:
  - Deceive C
- B's Goal:
  - Assist C

## What if A is a machine ?

Would C be **as often** wrong ?

## A Modern Experiment: The Imitation Game Revisited

*Human or Not? A Gamified Approach to the Turing Test* @jannai2023

Online 2-player game:

- One player asks questions and must guess "Human" or "Bot"
- The other player responds and might be substituted by a bot
- Bots are advanced LLM models (e.g., GPT-3)

## Turing test: Current outcomes 

- 73% Chance to recognize a real person
- 60% chance to recognize a bot

Ineffective strategies:
  - Checking grammar, spelling, recent events

Effective strategies:
  - Recognizing known issues and biases
  - Identifying hallucinations

## Historical Definitions of AI

- John McCarthy:
"Artificial Intelligence is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs."
  - **Reference**: McCarthy, J. (2007). Stanford University.

- Marvin Minsky:
- Artificial Intelligence is "the science of making machines do things that would require intelligence if done by men."
  - **Reference**: Minsky, M. (1968). MIT Press.=

## Recent Definitions of AI

-  Luc Julia:
"There is no intelligence in AI. It's just pure mathematical optimization."
  - **Reference**: Julia, L. (2019). "La Voix de l'IA". First Editions.
