## Can Machine Think ?

@Turing1950

- Defining a machine
- Understanding "thinking"

## The Imitation Game

::: columns
::: column
Context:

- A: Man
- B: Woman
- C: Interrogator

Rules:

- A and B are known as X and Y to C
- C interrogates X and Y
- Responses are typewritten
:::

::: column
Objectives:

- C's Goal: 
  - Determine 'X is A and Y is B' or 'X is B and Y is A'
- A's Goal:
  - Deceive C
- B's Goal:
  - Assist C

## What if A is a machine ?

Would C be **as often** wrong ?

## A Modern Experiment: The Imitation Game Revisited

*Human or Not? A Gamified Approach to the Turing Test* @jannai2023

Online 2-player game:

- One player asks questions and must guess "Human" or "Bot"
- The other player responds and might be substituted by a bot
- Bots are advanced LLM models (e.g., GPT-3)

## Turing test: Current outcomes 

- 73% Chance to recognize a real person
- 60% chance to recognize a bot

Ineffective strategies:
  - Checking grammar, spelling, recent events

Effective strategies:
  - Recognizing known issues and biases
  - Identifying hallucinations

*"**Artificial Intelligence** is the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs.*"

<div class="origin-citation">
From John McCarty (2007). Stanford University.
</div>

<hr style="height:1px;border:none;color:#333;background-color:#333;">

***Artificial Intelligence** is "the science of making machines do things that would require intelligence if done by men."*
<div class="origin-citation">
from Marvin Minsky (1968). MIT Press.

## Alternative definitions
<div style="font-size: 65%;">
- Human-oriented
  - *We call **programs intelligent** if they exhibit behaviors that would be regarded intelligent if they were exhibited by **human beings**.* - Herbert Simon
  - ***AI** is the attempt to make **computers** do what **people** think computers cannot do.* - Douglas Baker
  - ***AI** is the study of how to make **computers** do things at which, at the moment, **people** are better.* - Elaine Rich and Kevin Knight

- Mathematics-oriented
  - ***AI** is the study of techniques for **solving exponentially hard problems** in polynomial time by exploiting knowledge about the problem domain.* - Elaine Rich
  - *There is no **intelligence** in **AI**. It's just pure **mathematical optimization***. - Julia Luc

- Intelligence-oriented
  - ***Physicists** ask what kind of place this universe is and seek to characterize its behavior systematically. **Biologists** ask what it means for a physical system to be living. We in **AI** wonder what kind of **information-processing system** can ask such questions.* - Avron Barr and Edward Feigenbaum
</div>

## Levels of AI

1. **Narrow AI**: Specialized in one task. E.g., voice assistants.
2. **General AI (AGI)**: Can perform any intellectual task that a human can.
3. **Superintelligent AI**: Surpasses human abilities. It's speculative and doesn't exist yet.


# What is intelligence {data-stack-name="What is Intelligence ?"}

## Dimensions of Intelligence

- Task-specific intelligence
- Field-specific intelligence
- Emotional intelligence
- Social intelligence
- Creative intelligence
- and so on ...

## Measuring Intelligence

- IQ Tests: Strengths and Limitations
- Multiple Intelligences Theory (Gardner 1983)
- Fluid vs. Crystallized Intelligence

## What Makes Human Intelligence Unique?

- **Adaptability**: Ability to learn and adapt to new environments and challenges.
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Recognizing and understanding emotions in oneself and others.
- **Abstract Thinking**: Conceptualizing ideas and making connections between unrelated domains.
- **Creativity**: Generating novel ideas and solutions.

## Animal Intelligence

- Animals exhibit specialized intelligence suited for their environment.
- E.g., Dolphins have social intelligence, Octopuses show problem-solving abilities.

## Machine Intelligence

- Operates based on algorithms and data.
- Doesn't "understand" or "feel" in the way humans do.
- Can process information faster and more accurately than humans.

## Measuring IA 

# What is Machine Learning? {data-stack-name="What is ML?"}

## Definition

Machine Learning is a subset of AI where machines can learn from data.

## Types of Machine Learning

- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Reinforcement Learning

## Major Milestones in ML

- Perceptrons (1950s)
- Backpropagation (1980s)
- Deep Learning Revolution (2010s)

# Major Dates and Periods {data-stack-name="History"}

## Timeline of AI and ML

- 1950: Turing's "Computing Machinery and Intelligence"
- 1956: Dartmouth Workshop - Birth of AI
- 1980s: Rise of Expert Systems
