## A Modern Experiment: The Imitation Game Revisited

*Human or Not? A Gamified Approach to the Turing Test* @jannai2023

**Online 2-player game:**

- One player asks questions and must guess **"Human"** or **"Bot"**
- The **other player** responds and **might be substituted** by a bot
- Bots are **advanced LLM models** (e.g., GPT-3)

## Turing test: Current outcomes 

::: {.box}
**73%** Chance to recognize **a real person**
:::

::: {.box}
**60%** chance to recognize **a bot**
:::

**Ineffective strategies:**

- Checking grammar, spelling, recent events

**Effective strategies:**

- Recognizing known issues and biases
- Identifying hallucinations

"*We call **programs intelligent** if they exhibit behaviors that would be regarded intelligent if they were exhibited by **human beings**.*" - Herbert Simon

"***AI** is the attempt to make **computers** do what **people** think computers cannot do.*" -- Douglas Baker

## Levels of AI

1. **Narrow AI**: Specialized in one task. *Translation*
2. **Broad AI**: Multimodel/Multitask. *ChatBot*
2. **General AI (AGI)**: Can perform any intellectual task that a human can.
3. **Superintelligent AI**: Surpasses human abilities. It's speculative and doesn't exist yet.

# What is intelligence {data-stack-name="What is Intelligence ?"}

## Theories of intelligence

- Two factor Theory (Spearmann)
- Multiple Intelligence (Gardner)
- Emotional Intelligence (Goleman)
- Fluid vs. Crystallized Intelligence (Cattell)

## What Makes Human Intelligence Unique ?

<div style="font-size: 65%;">
- **Instinct**: Innate behaviour *Respiration*
- **Memory**: The capacity to recall knowledge and events.
- **Learn**: The capability to acquire knowledge and skills.
- **Logic and Reason**: Ability to applies rules of logic to reach conclusions.
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Recognizing and understanding emotions in oneself and others.
- **Abstraction/Concepts**: Conceptualizing ideas and making connections between unrelated domains.
- **Creativity**: Generating novel ideas and solutions.
- An so on ...

&rarr; Human intelligence is multifaceted.

## Machine Intelligence

- Operates based on algorithms and data.
- Doesn't "understand" or "feel" in the way humans do.
- Can process information faster and more accurately than humans.

## Measuring human intelligence

- IQ Tests
- Complex and contraversary
- Educational exams
- no single definitive method

## Measuring Narrow IA intelligence

- Precision / Specificity for classification
- Regression coeficient for regression
- Will be extensively discussed later.

## Measuring Artificial General intelligence

<div style="font-size: 75%;">
- **General Tests**:
  - AI2 Reasoning Challenge
  - HellaSwag
  - MMLU
  - TruthfulQA
- **Field-specific Exams**:
  - University exams (e.g., Bar exam, Math exams)
  - Math challenges

&rarr; AGI measurement is closer to human intelligence assessment.

# What is Machine Learning? {data-stack-name="What is ML?"}

## Definition

Machine Learning is a subset of AI where machines can learn from data.

## What is a machine

- Logical model
- Mathematical model
- Theory-driven
- Data-driven

## Machine learning vs Human learning

- Machine learn through optimization.
  - Numerical optimizations with objective function
  - Reinforcement learning
  - Genetic algorithms

Optimization can be see widely such as PCA is a optimization to maximize variance.

## Major Dates and Periods 

- 1950: Turing's "Computing Machinery and Intelligence"
- 1956: Dartmouth Workshop - Birth of AI
- 1980s: Rise of Expert Systems
- 1990s: Machine Learning Gains Popularity
- 2010s: Deep Learning Era Begins
- 2020s: Emergence of Large Language Models

## Conclusion {data-name="Conclusion"}

- Artificial intelligence is a wide concept with multiple definitions
  - human-oriented
  - mathematic-oriented
  - intelligence-centered
- Intelligence is a a wide notion when applied to human.
- Machine intelligence

## Objectives

- Definition of Machine Learning
- Mathematics and Statistics
- Implement and train models
- Knowledge and best practices
